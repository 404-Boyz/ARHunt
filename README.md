ScavengAR is an augmented reality, city-wide scavenger hunt application.  Users are led on a tour of local points of interest by following fun clues.

Currently the only tour available is the Speakeasy Stroll in Chicago.  The app is still in development, but we are already working on more tours.  If you have a suggestion for one, let us know and we may just add it to the list!  That being said, we plan on adding a feature to allow users to upload their own.

You can see it in action at https://exp.host/@luksta/arhunt

You'll need to download the expo app and run it from there.  While we designed it with React Native it has only been tested on Iphone.  Fair warning, if you run it on an Android we cannot guarantee it will perform as intended.
